 - Everything should be run from <main.py>.
 - Before running an experiment, create directories <../[00LF] data/> and <../[03LF] experiments/>
 - Before running an experiment, the data must be available in the appropriate place (../[00LF] data/*).
 - Toy data can be generated using the <*Toy*.to_dataframe()> functions present in <main.py>.
 - MNIST and TIDIGITS data must be downloaded first from an outside source.
 - Experiments can be run by uncommenting the appropriate experiment in <main.py>.
 - After running a experiment, it can be evaluated using the Experiment.evaluate(...) function present in <main.py>.

Note that in the paper most experiments have been assigned a different index:
	code index -> thesis index
	6 -> 2
		6.1a -> 2.1
		6.1b -> 2.2
		6.1c -> 2.3a
		6.1d -> 2.3b
		6.1e -> 2.3c
	2 -> 3
	3 -> 4
	4 -> 5
	
	5 -> omitted
